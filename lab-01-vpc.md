# Lab 1: VPC and Networking Foundation

## Understanding VPC
A VPC is your private network in AWS. Think of it as your own data center in the cloud where you control IP ranges, subnets, and routing.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of AWS VPC
- Create a VPC with public and private subnets
- Configure Internet Gateway and routing tables
- Understand CIDR blocks and availability zones
- Know which resources are free vs. paid

## Architecture Overview
This lab creates a foundational VPC infrastructure with:
- 1 VPC with DNS support enabled
- 2 Public subnets across different AZs
- 2 Private subnets across different AZs
- 1 Internet Gateway
- Route tables for public subnet internet access

## Prerequisites
- Completed AWS CLI and Terraform setup from main README
- Basic understanding of networking concepts

## Cost Information
**Lab 1 Total Cost: $0.00 (All resources are FREE!)**

âœ… **FREE Resources:**
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Subnets (Public and Private)
- Internet Gateway
- Route Tables and Route Table Associations
- Security Groups
- NACLs (Network Access Control Lists)

## Create the Terraform Configuration

Create a new directory for your lab:
```bash
mkdir aws-terraform-lab
cd aws-terraform-lab
```

**File: `main.tf`**
```hcl
# =============================================================================
# TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# This file creates a basic AWS VPC infrastructure with public and private subnets
# suitable for hosting web applications with proper network isolation.

terraform {
  # Require Terraform version 1.0 or higher for stability and feature support
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  
  # Specify required providers and their versions
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"  # Use AWS provider version 5.x (latest stable)
    }
  }
}

# Configure the AWS Provider
# This tells Terraform which AWS region to deploy resources in
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# =============================================================================
# VARIABLES
# =============================================================================
# Variables allow customization of the infrastructure without modifying the code

# AWS Region where all resources will be created
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"  # N. Virginia - popular choice for its extensive service availability
}

# Project name used for consistent resource naming and tagging
variable "project_name" {
  description = "Project name for tagging"
  type        = string
  default     = "aws-lab"  # Will be prefixed to all resource names
}

# =============================================================================
# DATA SOURCES
# =============================================================================
# Data sources fetch information about existing AWS resources

# Get list of available Availability Zones in the current region
# This ensures we deploy across multiple AZs for high availability
data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {
  state = "available"  # Only include AZs that are currently available
}

# =============================================================================
# SUBNETS
# =============================================================================

# Public Subnets
# These subnets have direct internet access via the Internet Gateway
# Ideal for load balancers, NAT gateways, and bastion hosts
# COST: FREE - Subnets themselves do not incur charges

# =============================================================================
# ROUTING
# =============================================================================

# Route Table for Public Subnets
# This defines how traffic flows from public subnets to the internet
# COST: FREE - Route tables do not incur charges
resource "aws_route_table" "public" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  # Route all internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through the Internet Gateway

    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.main.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.project_name}-public-rt"
  }
}

# Associate Public Subnets with Public Route Table
# This connects each public subnet to the route table, enabling internet access
# COST: FREE - Route table associations do not incur charges
resource "aws_route_table_association" "public" {
  count = length(aws_subnet.public)          # Associate all public subnets

  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public[count.index].id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public.id
}
```

## Deploy the VPC

```bash
# For PowerShell users with named profiles:
$env:AWS_PROFILE="PROFILE_NAME"

# Then run Terraform commands:
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Verification Steps

### Lab Exercise 1
1. **AWS Console Verification:**
   - Log into AWS Console and navigate to VPC service
   - Find your created VPC, subnets, and internet gateway
   - Note the CIDR blocks and availability zones
   - Verify that public subnets have "Auto-assign public IPv4 address" enabled

2. **Terraform Output Verification:**
   ```bash
   terraform show
   terraform state list
   ```

3. **Understanding the Architecture:**
   - Identify which subnets are public vs private
   - Understand the routing differences
   - Note the high availability setup across multiple AZs

## Key Concepts Learned

### VPC Components
- **VPC**: Isolated network environment
- **Subnets**: Segments within your VPC
- **Internet Gateway**: Provides internet access
- **Route Tables**: Control traffic routing
- **CIDR Blocks**: IP address ranges

### Best Practices Implemented
- **High Availability**: Resources across multiple AZs
- **Security**: Separation of public and private subnets
- **Scalability**: Room for IP address growth
- **Tagging**: Consistent resource naming and identification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Terraform fails to find availability zones**
   - Solution: Ensure you're using a valid AWS region

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Solution: Verify AWS credentials and IAM permissions

3. **Resource already exists errors**
   - Solution: Check for existing resources with same names

## Clean Up
```bash
terraform destroy
```
Type `yes` when prompted.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to [Lab 2: EC2 Instances and Security Groups](lab-02-ec2.md)
- Learn about adding compute resources to your VPC
- Understand security groups and their role in network security
